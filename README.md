# expms
expms produces expression data (quantitative) from an ms output.
The idea is the same as in the microsat.c plugin of Hudson. a mutation may have either a positive or a negative effect on the expression level. 
There is also environmental noise which has 0 mean and 1 variance

The new code is in expression.c
